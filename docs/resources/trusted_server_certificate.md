## Schema

### Optional

- **certificate** (String)
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **name** (String) Certificate Name

~> **Note** Creating a Terraform plan for updating the certificate for a service has a dependency. The certificate creation should be completed prior to the service update, without which the operation would result in an error. Only after this step can the old certificate be deleted.
